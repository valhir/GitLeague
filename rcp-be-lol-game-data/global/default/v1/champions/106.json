Cultivating a deep hatred of civilization and the weakness it brought with it, he now fights to return to the old ways—when the land was untamed, and blood spilled freely—and eagerly battles all who oppose him, with tooth, claw, and thundering domination.","tacticalInfo":{"style":4,"difficulty":1,"damageType":"kPhysical"},"playstyleInfo":{"damage":2,"durability":3,"crowdControl":2,"mobility":2,"utility":1},"squarePortraitPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-icons/106.png","stingerSfxPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-sfx-audios/106.ogg","chooseVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-choose-vo/106.ogg","banVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-ban-vo/106.ogg","roles":["fighter","tank"],"recommendedItemDefaults":[],"skins":[{"id":106000,"isBase":true,"name":"Volibear","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/106/106000.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/106/106000.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/106/106000.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Volibear/Skins/Base/VolibearLoadscreen.Voli.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":106001,"isBase":false,"name":"Thunder Lord Volibear","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/106/106001.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/106/106001.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/106/106001.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Volibear/Skins/Skin01/VolibearLoadscreen_1.Voli.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":52}],"description":"In an age before man, King Voli ruled the bitter northlands, and he was as harsh and unforgiving as they were.
